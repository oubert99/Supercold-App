# Using the Supercold Widget as an App Icon

This guide explains how to use the Supercold widget as an alternative to the standard app icon, giving you a live-updating view of your cold shower tracking data right on your home screen.

## What is the "Cold Shower Icon" Widget?

The "Cold Shower Icon" widget is a special small widget designed to look like an app icon but with live data. It displays:

1. A compact yearly grid showing all your cold shower days
2. Your current streak count
3. The app name

This gives you a quick visual representation of your progress throughout the year, right on your home screen!

## Setting Up the Widget as an App Icon

### Step 1: Add the Widget to Your Home Screen

1. Long-press on an empty area of your home screen until the apps start jiggling
2. Tap the "+" button in the top-left corner
3. Scroll down and find "Supercold" in the widget list
4. Select the "Cold Shower Icon" widget (not the regular tracker widget)
5. Choose the small size (this is designed to be app icon sized)
6. Tap "Add Widget"
7. Position the widget where you want it on your home screen
8. Tap "Done" in the top-right corner

### Step 2: Organize Your Home Screen

For the best experience:

1. Place the widget in a prominent position where you would normally have your app icon
2. Move the actual Supercold app icon to:
   - A secondary home screen page
   - A folder
   - The App Library (you can remove it from the home screen entirely)

This way, you'll use the widget as your primary way to access the app, while still having the actual app available when needed.

## How to Use the Widget

### Launching the App

Simply tap the widget to open the Supercold app, just like you would with a regular app icon.

### Viewing Your Progress

The widget automatically shows:

- A tiny dot for each day of the year (cyan for completed days, gray for incomplete)
- Your current streak count at the bottom
- The app name at the top

This gives you a constant visual reminder of your progress and streak, encouraging you to maintain your cold shower habit.

## Troubleshooting

If the widget isn't updating:

1. Make sure you've taken at least one cold shower and logged it in the app
2. Try removing and re-adding the widget
3. Restart your device
4. Check that you have the latest version of the app

## Benefits of Using the Widget as an App Icon

1. **Visual Motivation**: See your progress at a glance every time you look at your home screen
2. **Streak Awareness**: Always know your current streak without opening the app
3. **Yearly Overview**: The dot grid gives you a bird's-eye view of your entire year's progress
4. **Unique Look**: Stand out with a dynamic, personalized app icon that reflects your actual data

Enjoy your new dynamic app icon experience with Supercold!
